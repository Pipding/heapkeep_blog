I considered titling this post "Trello" just so the first 2 posts would be very similar. Anyway...

# Trello
I overcame my natural instincts and instead of diving directly into implementation, I actually created a Trello board and user personas for the project. The Trello board isn't publicly accessible but it's here. You're welcome, Ryan from the future: [https://trello.com/b/5oDsffjV](https://trello.com/b/5oDsffjV)

Sidenote: Anyone who tells you that adding images to a Jekyll blog is straighforward is a filthy liar.

I've used scrum & kanban in my day job for years so I'm going to stick with what I'm used to;
- One board to use as a backlog
- One board for each two-week sprint

I'm not falling into the trap of trying to plan 6 sprints ahead. Particularly at this early stage, the direction the research will take is so uncertain that it would be difficult to guess what I'll need to be doing in 7 weeks' time. Instead I'll try to keep a regular schedule of backlog grooming and sprint planning toward the end of each sprint. As new tasks pop up I'll put them in the backlog and evaluate their priority.

# User Personas
One of the recommendations from my first supervision seminar was to create user personas. It's a good suggestion, in fairness. My target audience has been very vague. I've decided I'll focus on...
<br>**Programmers exploring a novel codebase**.

I'm going with this instead of something like "novice programmers" or "technical managers" for a couple of reasons;
* One of the more interesting aspects to me is how HeapKeep will fare in teaching someone about the structure of a program with little or no context
* I'm fairly sure this project will rely on qualitative analysis rather than quantitative, so a diverse set of skill levels may prove valuable
* I think it'll be easier to source people in this demographic. Any programmer fits, provided I give them a codebase they've never seen

Anyway, to you I present; user personas.
