Experiment design is daunting to think about but it has to be done and it has to be done early. I need to know what I'm working towards in my artifact and I need to consider the ethics of the experiment so I can apply for approval as early as possible.

# Experiment Outline
Participants will be divided into two groups: control and experiment. Before assignment, they will complete a short survey with a particular focus on programming expertise. The information gathered from this survey will be used to employ stratified sampling to ensure both groups are as balanced as possible with regard to programming expertise.

## General Procedure
All participants will receive a novel codebase and will have 10 minutes to explore it in isolation (hereafter referred to as the `familiarisation period`). After this, they will complete a set of assigned tasks (e.g. fixing a bug, extending a class, modifying an enum). Finally, they will participate in an interview about their experience wherein they will be asked to suggest architectural improvements to the codebase.

Participants will be asked to provide stream-of-consciousness commentary during the `familiarisation period` and while completing their assigned tasks. Audio will be recorded throughout all phases of the study for qualitative analysis. Execution of assigned tasks will not be directly recorded, however metrics such as solution correctness and time taken will be measured for quantitative analysis.

### Control Group
Participants will explore the codebase using a standard IDE during the `familiarisation period`.

### Experiment Group
Participants will explore the codebase through **HeapKeep** during the `familiarisation period`. Their use of **HeapKeep** will be screen-recorded for analysis.

# Ethical Considerations
#### **Consent to collection of performance metrics and other personal data**
Limited personal information, such as email addresses, and performance metrics will be recorded during the experiment. Email addresses will be used to contact participants and may be linked to survey results to sort participants into either the experiment or control groups. Performance metrics during the programming test will be collected for the purpose of quantitative analysis.

Prospective participants must consent to the collection of such data. Every effort should be made to ensure the security of this data. Personally-identifiable-information such as email addresses will have a clearly-defined retention period, no longer than necessary to complete the thesis and its review process. After this period the data will be deleted.

#### **Consent to being recorded**
Participants will be made aware that their utterances and screen activity may be recorded in the course of the experiment. They will also be informed that such recordings will be used only for qualitative analysis and will not be shared with any third party not involved with the study without prior consent. Participants who do not consent to being recorded may still take part in the experiment, with the caveat that their activities may not contribute to qualitative analysis.

Recordings made during the experiment will be subject to the same data retention policy as personal data - being deleted after a period no longer than necessary to the thesis document and its review process.

#### **Data Protection**
Participant data will be stored securely and privately during the retention period. Data should be stored in an encrypted and password-protected format and access should be limited to personnel directly involved in the experiment, the thesis document and academic review thereof. All data collected from participants should be destroyed after the retention period.

#### **Anonymisation**
Measures should be taken to anonymise data collected from participants. Audio recordings may be distorted or otherwise masked to conceal the identity of the participants.

#### **Right to Withdraw**
Participants may choose to withdraw from the study at any time and without giving a reason. In case of withdrawal, all data collected about the participant should be deleted without undue delay.

#### **Use of AI Tools for Data Analysis**
AI tools, such as AI-assisted audio transcription, may be used during the post-experiment analysis. Participant data will not be used in conjunction with any AI tool without prior written consent. The use of such tools must comply with all other data collection, protection, anonymisation and destruction policies outlined in this document. Specifically, participant data will be removed from AI tools at the conclusion of the retention period. This requires that participant data should not be used with tools that cannot guarantee complete deletion of data.
